# Machine-Learning
Python implementation of Andrew Ng's course and other machine learning algorithms (not included in the course).
All machine learning algorithms have been implemented using both numpy and scikit - learn and the datasets used have been included with the respective algorithms. 
A short theory report of the same has been uploaded. 
Thanks for visiting!
